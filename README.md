# PhyBullet - Bullet backend for PhySMC

> NOTE!: This is a work in progress and the API is NOT stable

Implements the core interface of [PhySMC](https://github.com/CNCLgithub/PhySMC) for `BulletSim` and `BulletState`.

Currently the only `Element{BulletSim}` implemented is `RigidBody` but others (such as those with complex joints) are possible. 

See `examples/` and `src/` for docstrings.
